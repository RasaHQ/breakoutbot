  - text: "Hey! Welcome to the breakoutbot adventure! You are in a room and it is
      your goal to escape from it. There seem to be three things in the room: a window,
      a box and a door. You can try to interact with these items and you can combine/pickup/use
      them try to escape. Everything is text based. For hints, try looking at items in the room.
      You can also ask for help. Good luck!"
  utter_help:
  - text: "This is a text based adventure game. The goal is to escape from the room
      but you can try to look around the room to find items that might help you escape.
      You can try to `look` and items, you might be able to `pick up` items and you
      can try to `use` items on other objects. Before you're able to combine items you
      first need to pick them up."
