  - text: "Hey! Welcome to the breakoutbot adventure! You are in a room and it is your goal to escape from it. There seem to be three things in the room: a window, a box and a door. You can try to interact with these items and you can combine/pickup/use them try to escape. Everything is text based. Good luck!"
  utter_help:
