  - text: "Hey! Welcome to the breakoutbot adventure! You are in a room and it is\
      \ your goal to escape from it. There seem to be three things in the room: a\
      \ window, a box and a door. You can try to interact with these items and you\
      \ can combine/pickup/use them try to escape. Everything is text based. For hints,\
      \ try looking at items in the room. You can also ask for help if you've never\
      \ played these sorts of games before. Good luck!"
  utter_help:
  - text: This is a text based adventure game. You're able to pick up items and you're
      also able to combine them in order to solve puzzles. You can try to `look` and
      items, you might be able to `pick up` items and you can try to `use` items on
      other objects. Before you're able to combine items you first need to pick them
      up. If you get stuck, feel free to ask for a hint!
  utter_hint:
  - text: Try looking at the window or cardbox box.
